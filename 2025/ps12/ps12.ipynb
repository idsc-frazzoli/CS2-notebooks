You can run the cell below to visualize the process (the sliders allow you to tweak the constraints).  Optimization is initialized at a point where gradients do not explode and for a low value of $t$, which allows to quickly find a first estimate of the minimum. Then, iteratively, $t$ is increased and a new optimization is done starting from the optimal $x$ found in the previous iteration. These iterations with progressively higher $t$ are repeated until convergence.\n","\n","This strategy makes it possible to find minima quickly and arbitrarily well, while avoiding areas with exploding gradients.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"xrpceTLKzLiV"},"id":"xrpceTLKzLiV"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from ipywidgets import interactive, FloatSlider\n","from IPython.display import display\n","\n","# Base convex function\n","def f0(x):\n","    return np.log1p(np.exp(0.5 * x)) + 0.02 * x**4\n","\n","# Total cost with normalized log-barrier\n","def total_cost(x, x1, x2, t):\n","    y0 = f0(x)\n","    W = x2 - x1\n","    s1 = (x - x1) / W\n","    s2 = (x2 - x) / W\n","    barrier = np.full_like(x, np.nan)\n","    feasible = (x > x1) & (x < x2)\n","    barrier[feasible] = - (1 / t) * (np.log(s1[feasible]) + np.log(s2[feasible]))\n","    return y0 + barrier\n","\n","def plot_iterative_barrier(x1, x2):\n","    x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 1000)\n","    t_values = [1, 10, 100]\n","    x_mins_total = []\n","\n","    #
